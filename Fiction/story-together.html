                                                        <p>
                                                           We all have had our parts of stories which never ended up like we planned. Isn’t it? Mine is simple. 
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                           Simple like a shepherd being lost in a valley covered with thousands of eucalyptuses and not knowing a way out. We both are lost, we both are adrifted, he physically and me mentally. I’m striving for moments of silence and searching for my own existence amidst a heartbreak. Yes! A heartbreak. We had a story together, and yes indeed a story together, all illusion, all fantasy, as what it is now.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                           As I look back, once again falling into the trap of unavoidable memories, awakened by the dead remains of those parts, I still am able to see the part of me which used to live then.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                           Eight years back, as an amateur I took admission in one of the arts college in our city. I had all the fantasy like notions of being into a college, hanging out with friends, chilling and all. I had planned everything from scratch. I had plans of dodging out and escaping the hostel. I had plans of playing pranks on my counterparts. I had all the plans of about how will I be spending my next three years. But, I forgot that college is also about attending classes and studying. I was a week late in joining the college, due to some engagements. But, I still remember entering into my first class excited, nervous, chivalrous all at the same time. Class was in a hustle, as if students were trying to absorb themselves into a new environment, with new people, with an all new identity. As I entered, I heard a voice saying, “Go sit with Tara!”. I nodded looking in the direction of the voice. I tried scanning the whole class, so as to trace where this girl was only to spot a girl in the middle row last second seat waving a hand at me. I smiled. Dressed in a red top, flavored with a blue skinny jeans and a pony tail, she appeared somewhat cute. Finally, bringing myself back to senses, I sat with her. We shared notes, but was that the only thing we shared that day? Coming late pretentiously and having to sit with her became a routine.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>   
                                                          We were growing closer, I could have had imagined her as my girlfriend, I could have had asked for a formal relationship, I could have had proposed her, but…
                                                          But, there was she, epitome of hypnotizing beauty and winsome like a droplet of adam’s ale on the petal of a rose, drifting down gently into the earth, making the most beautiful of all gullible. Seeing her was just a metaphor of holding a heaven full of stars in a dark night, symbolic of beauty and hopes in eyes, wanting to keep the gaze forever. Entangled into curls, flicking against her forehead her hairs were the most captivating attribute of her beauty. Eyes none less than any ocean, beautiful yet conspiring as if they hid a secret behind their gaze. Most popular amongst all, yet simple by essence made her somewhat different.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                          And, there was me, a nerd struggling for an identity, struggling for a good phase. We didn’t had a chance together, neither here nor in anyone’s wildest dreams.
                                                          We were good friends and I loved spending time with her, I loved every moment spent with her, I loved being myself with her. We used to share even the tiniest details from our lives, from waking up till getting to the bed. Living every moment with her became a daily routine.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                           I still remember the day when I lost sway over my emotions, I was in tears, narrating what all went wrong. She was listening, listening like a kid. She could have said many things to console me, but she just held my hand and said, “Everything will be fine”, with a soothing and gentle smile. There were cracks on each and every wall of my heart, and I always longed for someone who could look beyond and enter that solitude-ridden place, full of darkness to the touch the real part within and for the very first time I found someone doing it, I found her standing, standing at the gateway of my heart. For the very first time I felt like my heart being touched, for the very first time I felt like being loved, for the very first time I realized that there’s so much into her beyond her beauty, for the very first time I realized she was not only pretty but she was a beautiful, beautifully carved in heaven. I was in love with her! She never confessed, but I somewhere knew, knew that it all will be great.
                                                        </p> 
                                                        <p>
                                                           “Such an irresponsible person you are!”, I said in a loud town when I caught her stealing scoops of ice-cream from college canteen. She turned around only to see me standing with my brows frowned and face abridged like a baby airing disapproval at that cup of ice cream in her hand. “How many times I need to tell you, you are not allowed to eat ice creams”, I added. “Well, by the way who are you to tell me this?”, she buzzed jokingly. “Well, I am your to-be-husband”, I said in a confident tone. “Yeah yeah”, she further added. “Take these tablets for three days, and you’ll be fine soon”, I ordered her while keeping a newly bought packet of tablets in her hand.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                            Three years later we had our farewell. We were brought to the realisation that we’ve finished too soon. We wanted more time together. Seeing her in a black saree was both alluring and hurting. At one hand, we would be sharing our last day at college together, at another it was the last day! We both graduated, never to loose contact. We both were hustling with our hectic schedules, still we used to communicate anyhow making time for each other. We were struggling with differences and making it work with hope.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                            One day I received a call from her. “Hello?”, she said. “What happened?”, I asked sensing the treble in her voice, indicative of something wrong. “Can we meet?”, She asked. I agreed. We decided to meet up at our favorite garden, we had memories coupled with that area. Those trees? They have witnessed our love. Those pavilions? They are the proof of the moments of us clinching each other madly consigning to oblivion. And those sunsets? They’ve seen us crying, me for her and her for me. “You love me?”, She asked. “Of course I love you”, I assured her holding her hand between my hands. “What happened? I’m worried”, I asked. She was in tears suddenly, I held her in arms comforting her. “Papa…”, She uttered. “Papa is diagnosed with liver damage, and he has been prescripted with liver transplant”, she continued. “You need help with finances? You need me to arrange a donor for papa? Tell me what can I do for you and papa”, I said interrupting her sentence in between and standing from my position to act immediately. She then held my hand and made me sit beside her. “He will go for surgery only if I marry Shiva”, she said as tears rolled down from her eyes. I was shocked, I was numb, not knowing how to react. I just kept sitting, and a drop of tear slipped down from my eyes. I wanted to cry, cry with my head in her laps and her fingers running through my hairs, but, I needed to support her. “Papa’s health should be your priority”, I said looking away from her, avoiding eye contact with her. “I’m sorry”, she exclaimed. “For what?”, I asked looking towards her ever-gleaming face which had turned pale. “For loving you too much. For missing you”, she said. “I’m sorry for wanting to see you everyday. For always thinking about you before going to sleep. For feeling upset if I don’t see you. For wanting to be on your side. For wanting to be a part of your life. Had I not loved you so hard, this phase would have been easier for me”, she further added with her cracking voice. I knew the pain in her voice which was pretending to be strong, I knew she was bound and I also knew she loved me, loved me like no one ever did, loved me to infinity and beyond. “We are so in love and we are loosing it all”, I continued. “If you need to go, I want you to know it’s okay. Yeah! It’s okay. I understand that”, I said while veiling all my pain under those sentences, and I knew that she too knew. “You’re screaming, and no one can hear you. But I can”, she said looking straight into my eyes as if asking me to shed all my pains in the form of tears . “It’s getting late, you must reach home by time”, I said. “Hmm…”, she replied. I kissed her forehead and turned around without even a word. Was I in tears? I knew she needed me, I knew she was expecting support, but time has come, time for me to let her be strong.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                            She said, “Goodbye!” and I just moved without even turning. I heard her crying, I too was in tears and wanted to hug her for the very last time. I wanted to spend more time with her, in her arms, feeling that warmth for the last time, but…
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                            Five years later since this incident i.e. Today, “How many times I need to tell you, you are not allowed to eat ice creams”, I said. “Well, by the way who are you to tell me this?”, Tara jokingly asked. “Well, I am your…”, my eyes filled when I was brought to the realisation, I saw tears rolling from her eyes with Shiva sitting just beside her and seeing her keenly. There was utter silence on the table. It was our college reunion today. Her eyes were wet, as if asking me for a reason why I never tried.
                                                        </p>

                                                            And you know what? We had a story together, a story Indeed…
